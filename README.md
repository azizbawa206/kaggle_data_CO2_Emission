The CO2 emissions dataset serves as a significant and valuable resource for comprehending the global climate challenge and devising strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of CO2 emissions on our planet. It provides crucial insights into the total CO2 emissions (in Mt) by countries worldwide from 1988 to 2018. The dataset can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=co2 as of 10th July 2023.
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of CO2 emissions, encompassing data from 1960 to 2018 for all countries globally. It consolidates information from reputable sources such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Researchers, policymakers, and the general public can utilize this dataset to gain valuable insights into the relative contributions of different countries to global CO2 emissions. Furthermore, it allows for monitoring emission trends over time and evaluating the effectiveness of climate policies.

Based on the accompanying charts, it is evident that Russia and Japan were prominent contributors to CO2 production, with the highest accumulated CO2 emissions recorded by the United States and Russia. However, according to data obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/ (accessed on 10th July 2023), it is highlighted that the United States and China are presently the leading emitters of CO2. This observation indicates a considerable shift towards a fossil fuel-based economy in the United States.
The CO2 emissions dataset holds significant value as it sheds light on the pressing issue of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), and its impact on the Earth's climate. In recent years, understanding the quantity of CO2 emitted by each country has become increasingly crucial for the development of effective climate policies and the mitigation of climate change effects.












From the charts Russia and Japan were the leading productin of C02 with a hightest accumations of C02 being U.S.A and Russia. However according (https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/ ( acesed 10/07/2023) U.S and China are the leading Emission of C02. 
Meaning U.S economy have shifted much more to Fissil fuel Econoy
